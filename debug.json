The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.

The importance of patents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Raw Materials   In 2015, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to the significant price decreases in crude oil. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.   Environmental Law Compliance   3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies).   Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies.

Environmental expenditures for capital 6   Table of Contents  projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.   In 2015, 3M expended about $26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $51 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.   While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.   * The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.  Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products.   * Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.  Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.   * The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M’s MD&A is presented in eight sections:   ·Overview ·Results of Operations ·Performance by Business Segment ·Performance by Geographic Area ·Critical Accounting Estimates ·New Accounting Pronouncements ·Financial Condition and Liquidity ·Financial Instruments   Forward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).   OVERVIEW   3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As described in Note 16,  effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.   Restructuring actions:   During the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on structural overhead, largely in the U.S., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on EMEA and Latin America. This impacted approximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share.   Earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders – diluted:   The following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per share for 2015 compared to 2014, and 2014 compared to 2013.

To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.   Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:   On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 86 percent funded at year-end 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 69 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2015 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan was 0.7%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, down 0.25% from 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2015 discount rate was 4.47%, up 0.37 percentage points from the year-end 2014 discount rate of 4.10%.

The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO), however the plan’s funded status decreased slightly in 2015 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate than the plan assets returned in 2015. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).   3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2016. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.

Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.7 percent in 2014, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from 2013. Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 1.0 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 1.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, lower pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), along with organic volume leverage, decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars reduced SG&A expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which reduced worldwide sales by 6.8 percent. This foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement expense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4 percent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014.   Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $85 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2014 when compared to 2013.

In 2015, like SG&A, R&D spending in U.S. dollars was reduced due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA   While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17.   32   Table of Contents  A summary of key information and discussion related to 3M’s geographic areas follow:     2015                  Europe,    Latin                     UnitedAsiaMiddle EastAmerica/Other             StatesPacific& AfricaCanadaUnallocatedWorldwide         Net sales (millions)  $12,049   $9,041   $6,228   $2,982   $(26)   $30,274   % of worldwide sales   39.8%   29.9%   20.5%   9.8%   —    100.0% Components of net sales change:                    Volume — organic ",

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.   Legal Proceedings:   The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings.

Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates.   34   Table of Contents  Pension and Postretirement Obligations:   3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715,  Compensation — Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.  ",

See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.   Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.

    "text": "calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the change to the spot yield curve approach, 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by $180 million. Including this $180 million, 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.

Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.   An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.

As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2015 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.   As of October 1, 2015, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M purification (which 36   Table of Contents  includes the Polypore Separations Media acquisition), Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety (which includes the Capital Safety acquisition), and Traffic Safety and Security.

In 2015, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.   3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.

Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2016 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.   Income Taxes:   The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,  Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result.

The strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement this strategy. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3M will continue to deploy capital towards research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate them.

    "text": "June 2014, in connection with the May 16, 2014 shelf registration, 3M re-commenced its medium-term notes program (Series F) under which 3M may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Included in this $9 billion are $8.17 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt) of notes previously issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015 as part of Series F. Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 10.   In August 2014, 3M amended and extended its existing $1.5 billion five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement to a $2.25 billion five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, with an expiration date of August 2019. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion, bringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lenders’ discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. Under the $2.25 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.   Balance Sheet:   3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.  ",

The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.   Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $3.868 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $6.339 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.471 billion. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $1.317 billion, driven by decreases in marketable securities. Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.154 billion, driven by increases in short-term debt.   The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at year-end — multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.9 at December 31, 2015 compared to 5.0 at December 31, 2014.

Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. 3M defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M.

Upon completion of this transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of Sumitomo 3M Limited. This was reflected as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, in April 2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.   In March 2013, 3M sold shares in 3M India Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in return for $8 million. The noncontrolling interest shares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in India. This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities regulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a result of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent. The $8 million received in the first quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of December 31, 2015.   Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending in 2016 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand- alone basis.

As discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts. 44   Table of Contents    Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M’s MD&A is presented in eight sections:   ·Overview ·Results of Operations ·Performance by Business Segment ·Performance by Geographic Area ·Critical Accounting Estimates ·New Accounting Pronouncements ·Financial Condition and Liquidity ·Financial Instruments   Forward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).   OVERVIEW   3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As described in Note 16,  effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.   Restructuring actions:   During the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on structural overhead, largely in the U.S., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on EMEA and Latin America. This impacted approximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share.

Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).   3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2016. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.   Beginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions for U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates of 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation will be matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The",

The Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.5 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.   24   Table of Contents  Corporate and Unallocated:   In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 16. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.   Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $104 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to Corporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below table. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&D cost absorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to Corporate.   Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $70 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. This decrease was driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which declined year-on-year by $162 million. Of this reduction, $116 million was allocated to",
