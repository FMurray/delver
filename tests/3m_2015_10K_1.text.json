A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments(primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2015. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies, interest ratesrelated to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will beexperienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion wouldnot materially impact the results.
